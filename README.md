# sim1 â€“ Simple Logic Simulation in SystemVerilog

This project is a basic digital logic simulator written in SystemVerilog as part of an academic assignment.

## Features

- Implements basic logic gates and circuits
- Supports simulation of input signals over time
- Designed for use with ModelSim or other Verilog-compatible simulators

## Usage

1. Open the project in your simulator (e.g., ModelSim).
2. Compile all `.sv` files.
3. Run the testbench provided.
4. Observe signal transitions in waveform.
